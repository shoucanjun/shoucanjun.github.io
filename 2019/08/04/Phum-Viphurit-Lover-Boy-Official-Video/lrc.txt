"Lover Boy"

Wandering the streets all through the night
Searching for the one to make me right
Wondering if she's the shade of you
And if so, should I try to see it through

Darling, I got my trust issues
Warning, you stay away
If we meet at the rendezvous
Take me away, sunray
Darling, I got my trust issues
Warning, you stay away
If we meet at the rendezvous
Take me away, sunray

Time and toys
May fill my heart with joy
I'll know peace when I'm your lover boy

I'll be your new school soul
Silver and gold
New desire
Friends on fire
Call me 'lover boy'

Darling, I got my trust issues
Warning, you stay away
If we meet at the rendezvous
Take me away, sunray
Darling, I got my trust issues
Warning, you stay away
If we meet at the rendezvous
Take me away, sunray
